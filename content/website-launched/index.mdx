Welcome to my newly launched personal website. Creating and maintaining an online space in which to collect of those articles, projects, and other resources that might usefully be shared with others has been a goal for a number of years. Of course, more pressing matters tend to come to the fore! It is only now in the summer of 2024 that I feel I have had sufficient time to start the process.

I look forward to slowly but surely updating the 'work (+ play)' section accoringly. In the coming weeks I hope to share more of my previous writing and work across a range of areas including the following:

- My work in non-profit as a Founder, Chair, and CEO
- My recent forays into design, illustration and writing
- Photography and art projects

In the meantime, for a potted history of my background in community focused work and more recently the arts, please do read the [**about**][1] page.
