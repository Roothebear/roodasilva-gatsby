All about OxfordshireAllIn!

Thank you for dropping by! I am a freelance full stack developer and love working alongside others to bring ideas to life with a range of front and back end technologies. This site documents my work, interests and continuing learning in this and related areas.

My career to date has included Founder and CEO roles in the UK's non-profit sector alongside freelance consulting in areas related to my prior experience. I am most interested in how technology can benefit society and individuals. I hope you'll enjoy browsing the projects, sketches, and blog articles above.
